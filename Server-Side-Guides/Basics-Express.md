# Express

### Basic Set Up

Install basics can also be found here [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).

**Terminal commands**
```js
mkdir or git clone <your repo url>
touch server.js
// creates a new js file
npm init
// initializes node
// adds package.json where
    scripts: "main":"server.js"
    // if server.js is not created prior, 
    // main will be "index.js" by default
```
Alternatively `npm init -y` will init with default settings
```js
npm i express
// installs express, adds dependencies
// + installs additional modules and adds package-lock.json
```

**In `server.js`**
Express uses `require` rather than `import` as seen in React and some other frameworks.
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// creates an instance of Express
const port = 3000;
// here use the port used with localhost
OR
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
// above will be used with dotenv 
// tells what port we are going to  be using
```

**Dotenv** is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. it stores configuration in the environment separate from code.

```js
// in terminal
npm i dotenv
touch .env
```
```js
// in the .env file
PORT = 3000
// or port corresponding to the one used above.
```

Getting started with backend and server-side, there might be a need to install `nodemon` - `nodemon` is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
```js
// this instance:
npm i nodemon
// globally:
npm i nodemon -g
OR sudo npm i nodemon -g
// "sudo" overrides permissions - use it sparingly
```

**Option** to add a `dev` config to package.json Scripts. this enables the command `npm dev` in the terminal as a shorthand.
```js
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

Create a `.gitignore` file, this prevents files listed within from being pushed to git
```js
touch .gitignore
// in .gitignore file add
node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
```

#### CRUD
This might come as a simple refresher, but CRUD stands for:

| HTTP Verb  | CRUD Operator  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| POST | Create |
| GET | Read |
| PUT | Update |
| DELETE | Delete |


#### REST (Representational state transfer)

| URL | HTTP Verb |  Action |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| /photos/         | GET | index |
| /photos/new      | GET | new |  
| /photos          | POST | create | 
| /photos/:id      | GET | show |      
| /photos/:id/edit | GET | edit |     
| /photos/:id      | PATCH/PUT | update |   
| /photos/:id      | DELETE | destroy |

###### Put vs. Patch
In a `PUT` request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced. With `PATCH`, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version. 

### Routing

`Routing` refers to how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc).
[Express Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

```js
app.method(path, handler)
```
